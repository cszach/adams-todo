Adam's To-do
============

_To my CS professor, Adam Purtee._

A simple to-do list app for the CLI. Nothing complicated, no fuss, no muss.
Simple, reliable, gets the job done. Finally a to-do app you can count on.

Design
------

```
$ todo list                # List all to-do's
$ todo CS project 3 12/8   # Add a to-do with a deadline
$ todo History assignment  # Add a to-do to be done today
$ todo done 5              # Mark to-do #5 as done
```
